This repository is dedicated to the project developed during the seminar 'Programming with Large Language Models.' Our objective for this seminar was to explore the practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) by undertaking a project in any domain of our choice. Initially, our project aimed to implement selective sound cancellation using deep learning models. The concept involved identifying different sounds within an audio file and utilizing a deep learning model to suppress user-selected sounds. However, due to the unavailability of an adequate dataset, we encountered challenges in training the deepfilternet model specifically for baby sounds. Despite this setback, we have documented our progress with deepfilter training in the 'Future Work' section of this repository, hoping it may serve as a valuable resource for those interested in continuing this project.
